# Machine learning approach to Delta hedging and Greek estimation
Ongoing work part of my master thesis looking into ML methods for Delta hedging and uncertainty quantification.

# Gaussian Process implementation
The project is based on the work of Ludkovski and Saporiti in their paper "KrigHedge: Gaussian Process surrogates for Delta Hedging". It can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08407
