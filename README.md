# Machine learning approach to Delta hedging and Greek estimation
Ongoing work part of my master thesis looking into ML methods for Delta hedging and uncertainty quantification.

# Progress
This repo will probably not be updated regularly. My progress can be tracked on the following Overleaf journal: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5f9fe446b798d400011e023d

# Gaussian Process implementation
The project is based on the work of Ludkovski and Saporiti in their paper "KrigHedge: Gaussian Process surrogates for Delta Hedging". It can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08407
